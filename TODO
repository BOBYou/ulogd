libipulog:
X handle multi-part nlmsgs
- Error checking at netlink socket
- forward port my timeout enabled read-function from libipq to libipulog
- man pages

kernel:
X queue the logging in the kernel and send multiple packets in one 
  multipart nlmsg
- add timer to flush queue in user-defineable time intervals
- one global queue doesn't work with multiple netlink groups :(( solution(s):
	- have 32 queues (dynamically generate them during rule insertion)
	- have only one global nlgroup (bad, reduces future usage)
	- queue only for one of 32 groups
- IPv6 ULOG target

ulogd:
X MYSQL output plugin
X syslog compatibility output plugin
- commandline option for "to fork or not to fork"
- various command line options (we don't even have --version)
- add support for capabilities to run as non-root
- big endian fixes
- man pages
- IPv6 support (core and extensions)
